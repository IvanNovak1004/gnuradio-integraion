## [0.3.3] - 2023-12-31
### Added
- Added support of Python interpreters/environments selected with `ms-python.python` extension ([Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-python/python), [VS marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python))

## [0.3.2] - 2023-12-26
### Added
- Initial module info query now detects if Python modules for GNURadio are not installed (ImportError)
- Added Python interpreter, PYTHONPATH and GNURadio Prefix settings to extension config

### Changed
- Removed `python-shell` dependency; replaced it with own `PythonShell` class

### Deprecated
- Removed `gnuradio-companion` and `grcc` executable path settings in favor of GNURadio Prefix

## [0.3.1] - 2023-12-20
### Added
- Added 'Convert XML to YAML' command to the block context menu in module view
- Added QA/Test files to the block's file tree
- Added C++ noblock support to modtool commands (Disable Block, Rename Block, Remove Block, Make YAML from Implementation) and to the block's file tree (implementation files)
- Added module view auto-refresh on certain modtool commands (Create Block, Rename Block, Remove Block, Update XML to YAML, Make YAML from Implementation)

### Changed
- Refactor - removed unnecessary `GNURadioController`:
  - Moved shell tasks (`gnuradio-companion` and `grcc`) to separate functions
  - Moved all modtool commands to separate functions
  - Moved tree view provider functionality to a separate class
- Changed error handling to catch only specific errors

### Fixed
- Fixed commands (Create Block, Rename Block, Convert XML to YAML) not waiting until modtool execution is finished, thus displaying success messages even on failure
- Fixed 'Convert XML to YAML' not working without blockname (made argument optional)
- Fixed 'Create Block' getting stuck on 'Tests' pick when creating C++ noblock

## [0.3.0] - 2023-12-13
### Added
- Added GNURadio Module view to the Explorer panel that enables:
  - Viewing all blocks in the module and corresponding files;
  - Creating new blocks;
  - Creating Python bindings (context menu);
  - Renaming blocks (context menu, keybind: F2);
  - Removing blocks (context menu, keybind: Del);
  - Performing common file actions (context menu and keybinds), like in the file explorer view:
    - Open to the Side (keybind: Ctrl+Enter);
    - Open Containing Folder (keybind: Alt+Ctrl+R);
    - Open With...;
    - Open Timeline;
    - Copy Path (keybind: Alt+Ctrl+C);
    - Copy Relative Path (keybind: Alt+Ctrl+Shift+C);
    - Select for Compare;
    - Compare with Selected.

### Changed
- Moved 'Edit Flowgraph' action to the navigation section of editor titlebar, so now it's a visible icon button
- Changed warning and success messages to show matching block names for commands with regex:
  - Create Python Bindings;
  - Disable Blocks;
  - Remove Blocks.

### Fixed
- Fixed rename not checking for uniqueness of a new name

## [0.2.2] - 2023-12-11
### Added
- Added custom modtool wrapper scripts and `python-shell` dependency
- Added a command to manually query module info (`gr_modtool info`): 
a workaround to activate the extension when the module has no blocks yet
- Added actions to compile/run GRC Flowgraph files or edit them in GNURadio Companion from the editor titlebar
- Added a filter (regex) when creating Python bindings, making YAML from implementation, disabling or removing blocks
- Added automatic blockname for modtool commands when a corresponding editor is in focus
- Added an option to pick Python/C++ QA when creating blocks

### Changed
- Replaced `child_process` with `python-shell` for modtool commands
- Replaced `child_process` with tasks for `gnuradio-companion` and `grcc`

### Fixed
- Fixed validation warning preventing the use of short names when creating blocks
- Fixed sanity checks when creating Python bindings or converting XML to YAML from the context menu
- Fixed GRC Flowgraph commands not executing on currently open files
- Fixed YAML block filter not working because of mismatched `extname` (`.yml` vs `.block.yml`)
